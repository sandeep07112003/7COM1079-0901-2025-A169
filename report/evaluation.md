\## Collaboration Notes (Added 2025-12-04)

A structured checklist was introduced during the final stages of the project to

ensure all rubric components were addressed. This improved coordination across

the team and reduced duplication of work. The checklist also ensured that all

required statistical outputs, visualisations, and documentation were validated

prior to final submission.
