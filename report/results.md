A Welch two-sample t-test was conducted on log-transformed daily trading volume to compare the pre-2020 and post-2020 periods. The test indicated a statistically significant difference between groups (t = 3.7245, p = 0.0002029). The mean log-volume was higher in the post period, with an estimated mean difference of +0.214 (95% CI [0.1013, 0.3267]). Although statistically significant, the effect size was negligible (Cohen’s d = 0.124; 95% CI includes zero), indicating that the practical magnitude of the change is small. These results support rejecting the null hypothesis while recognising limited practical impact.
