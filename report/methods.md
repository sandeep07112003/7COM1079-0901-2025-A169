Methods (draft)

* RQ: Difference in mean daily trading volume pre/post 2020-01-01
* Cleaning: src/data\_cleaning.R (duplicates removed, volume numeric enforced)
* Visuals: src/visuals\_draft.R (boxplot + histogram with bell-curve)
* Stats: src/stats\_checks.R (Shapiro sample tests, descriptive table)





\### Figure Reference Notes (Added 2025-12-04)

The histogram (Figure 1) illustrates the distribution of log-volume and confirms

variance stabilisation. The boxplot (Figure 2) supports comparison of central

tendency across periods. These figures directly align with the statistical tests

conducted and support the interpretation presented in Section 4.
