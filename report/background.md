2.1 Review of Relevant Research Papers (200 words)



Recent studies have examined how major market events influence trading behaviour and liquidity. Kim and Park (2021) analysed trading activity on the Korean Exchange during the COVID-19 outbreak and found significant increases in volatility and retail trading participation, consistent with shifts in liquidity regimes. Similarly, Narayan et al. (2020) reported that global equity markets experienced abnormal volume and price dynamics during the early pandemic, emphasising that volume often rises sharply during periods of heightened uncertainty. A third study by Baker et al. (2020) demonstrated that pandemic-driven sentiment shocks produced unprecedented market responses, including spikes in trading volume and rapid liquidity deterioration.



Although these studies document macro-level disruptions, few examine firm-specific, daily-frequency trading volume to determine whether structural breaks persist beyond temporary shocks. Furthermore, existing work generally focuses on broad indices rather than individual companies with deep liquidity, such as Samsung Electronics. By analysing high-resolution stock-level data, this study bridges a gap in understanding how long-term trading behaviour may have changed following 2020 and whether shifts observed during the crisis period translated into sustained changes in trading intensity.



2.2 Why the RQ Is of Interest (Research Gap \& Future Directions) (100 words)



The research question addresses an important gap: whether the trading-volume disruption associated with early 2020 represents a temporary shock or a longer-term structural shift. Existing studies focus primarily on volatility, sentiment, or market indices, with limited attention to sustained changes in firm-level activity. Samsung Electronics, being highly liquid and widely traded, offers a strong case for detecting persistent shifts. Identifying whether post-2020 trading intensity remained elevated helps inform liquidity modelling, risk assessment, and market-microstructure research. Future work may extend this analysis to cross-sectional comparisons, alternative breakpoints, or multivariate models that account for volatility, news flow, or macroeconomic conditions.
