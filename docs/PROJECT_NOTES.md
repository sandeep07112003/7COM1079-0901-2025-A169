\### Folder Naming Rules (Added 2025-12-04)



\- All draft outputs should include the suffix \*\_draft to avoid confusion.

\- Final report-ready resources must include \*\_final for consistency.

\- Data files follow the convention: samsung\_<stage>.csv

\- Keeping naming conventions consistent improves traceability across the project.
